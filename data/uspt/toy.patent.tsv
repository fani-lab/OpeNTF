10019910	utility	10019910	US	2018-07-10	Systems and methods can dynamically set user-specific schedules for prompting users to access educational content objects. An educational performance metric is identified for a user. A learning schedule is accessed that includes an identification of a plurality of learning episodes. Each of the plurality of learning episodes is associated with a time-related variable indicative of when the learning episode is to occur and a substance-related variable indicative of a learning substance for the learning episode. The learning schedule is adjusted based on the identified educational performance metric and associated with the user. A presentation time is identified based on a time-related variable in the learning schedule. An electronic content object associated with the presentation time is identified based on a substance-related variable the learning schedule. A notification with an offer to access the identified electronic content object is presented at the presentation time via a device of the user.

10347145	utility	10347145	US	2018-07-09	Embodiments ensure that a user performs educational tasks, such as answering predetermined test questions, on a mobile phone or other wireless electronic device. When predetermined usage limits on the mobile phone are met, application programs on the mobile phone are suspended until the user performs an educational task. In some embodiments, once the usage criteria are met, the mobile phone is able to make calls to or receive calls from only predetermined numbers. Normal use is restored only after the educational task is performed. Usage limits include a maximum number of connections (e.g., calls made and received) on the mobile phone, a maximum cost of calls, and a maximum total duration of calls, all within an allotment period.

10775863	utility	10775863	US	2020-09-15	Methods and apparatuses to manage working states of a data processing system. At least one embodiment of the present invention includes a data processing system with one or more sensors (e.g., physical sensors such as tachometer and thermistors, and logical sensors such as CPU load) for fine grain control of one or more components (e.g., processor, fan, hard drive, optical drive) of the system for working conditions that balance various goals (e.g., user preferences, performance, power consumption, thermal constraints, acoustic noise). In one example, the clock frequency and core voltage for a processor are actively managed to balance performance and power consumption (heat generation) without a significant latency. In one example, the speed of a cooling fan is actively managed to balance cooling effort and noise (and/or power consumption).

10849564	utility	10849564	US	2020-12-01	Apparatus for automatically determining which type of resuscitation treatment is most appropriate for a patient. The apparatus comprising at least one processor, circuitry for delivering time-domain signal measurements to the processor(s), which transforms the time-domain signal measurements into frequency domain data representative of a frequency content of the time-domain signal measurements, processes the frequency domain data to form a plurality of spectral bands, a content of each of the plurality of spectral bands representing the frequency content of the time-domain signal measurements within a different frequency band, form a weighted sum of the content of the plurality of spectral bands, with different weighting coefficients applied to the plurality of spectral bands, wherein magnitudes of the weighting coefficients are non-linearly proportional to frequencies of the plurality of spectral bands to which the weighting coefficients are applied, and determines the type of resuscitation treatment based on the weighted sum.

10897495	utility	10897495	US	2020-01-19	The present description is directed towards systems and methods for directing a user request for content over a network to a given content server on the basis of one or more rules. Methods and systems implemented in accordance with the present description comprise receiving a request for content form a user, the request for content including a profile of the user identifying one or more characteristics associated with the user. One or more rules are retrieved for identifying a content server to which a request for content is to be delivered, the one or more rules including at least one of business rules, network rules, and user profile rules. The one or more retrieved rules are applied to the request for content to identify a content server to which the request for content is to be delivered and the request for content is delivered to the identified content server.

4193115	utility	4193115	US	2020-03-11	 An adaptive control system is disclosed in which control functions involving many input variables are computed by referring to data stored in a memory. Each value of the control functions is distributed over a number of physical memory locations, such that the linear sum of the contents of these physical locations defines the value. An addressing algorithm is used in which the input variables are mapped into a set of intermediate mapping variables. Apparatus for accomplishing the intermediate mapping comprises first and second counters which are used to address a memory in which the intermediate variables are stored in a predetermined arrangement.
