                    Team recommendation involves selecting skilled experts to form
                    an almost surely successful collaborative team, or refining the team
                    composition to maintain or excel at performance. To eschew the
                    tedious and error-prone manual process, various computational (Figure 1) and
                    social science theoretical approaches have been proposed wherein
                    the problem definition remains essentially the same, while it has
                    been referred to by such other names as team allocation, selection, composition, and formation. In this tutorial, we study the
                    advancement of computational approaches from greedy search in
                    pioneering works to the recent learning-based approaches, with
                    a particular in-depth exploration of graph neural network-based
                    methods as the cutting-edge class, via unifying definitions, formulations, and evaluation schema. More importantly, we then discuss
                    team refinement, a subproblem in team recommendation that involves structural adjustments or expert replacements to enhance
                    team performance in dynamic environments. Finally, we introduce
                    training strategies, benchmarking datasets, and open-source tools,
                    along with future research directions and real-world applications.

                           The early computational models for team
                           recommendation were developed in operations research (OR), optimizing objectives
                           using integer linear and/or nonlinear programming (IP). Such work, however, was
                           premised on the mutually independent selection of experts and overlooked the
                           organizational and/or social ties. To bridge the gap, graph-based approaches have
                           been proposed to recommend teams via subgraph optimization where the different aspects
                           of real-world teams are captured like communication cost and geographical proximity. This
                           section of our tutorial provides an overview of the graph-based approaches in
                          team recommendation methods.

                            Reinforcement learning with neural policy estimators has been increasingly employed to learn the dynamics of real-world teams
                            for structural modifications or team member replacements in order to maintain or even improve team effectiveness by
                            modeling the problem in a multi-agent setting where a group of agents synchronize their actions in a decentralized manner within
                            a shared environment to achieve a common goal. The task cannot be completed by any individual agent alone but in a team of agents,
                            and each agent must make a decision regarding which team to join.

                                In search of an optimal team, companies further look for skilled
                                users in a region where the organization is geographically
                                based, which leads to new challenges as it requires drilling
                                down on the skills of users while maintaining the condition of a
                                given geolocation. We conclude our tutorial by bringing forth
                                the spatial team recommendation problem; that is, given a set of
                                users, skills and geolocations, the goal is to determine whether
                                the combination of skills and geolocations in forming teams has
                                synergistic effects.

                                In real-world team recommendation scenarios, balancing multiple, often
                                conflicting objectives (e.g., team effectiveness and experts' workload distribution)
                                requires a training process guided by a loss function that explicitly accounts for
                                multiple objectives. However, existing neural team recommendation approaches, which
                                commonly frame the problem as a classification or link prediction task, aim to maximize
                                the coverage of the required skills and mainly rely on standard loss functions such as
                                cross-entropy, and designing a task-aware loss function is overlooked.

                            In this section, we highlight the practical significance of team recommendation by
                            explaining its seemingly unrelated yet highly valuable applications in education,
                            research, and healthcare, in addition to its common use cases.
                            <span className="d-block w-100 justify-paragraph">
                                <ul>
                                  <li><b> Group Learning: </b>
                                    Team recommendation finds immediate application in group-based learning environments.
                                    In online classes, where physical presence and interaction are absent, team recommendation connects students to share ideas and build relationships.
                                    This not only enhances their social skills but also combats the isolation that can sometimes accompany remote learning.
                                    Via working in teams, students are exposed to varying viewpoints, backgrounds, and problem-solving approaches.
                                  </li>
                                  <li><b> Reviewer Assignment: </b>
                                    Another immediate application of team recommendation is in peer-review assignments where a group of reviewers
                                    are paired with manuscripts within the reviewers' expertise for high-quality reviews while managing conflicts of interests.
                                    Like team recommendation, herein, research topics (skills) and reviewers (experts) are mapped into a
                                    latent space and, given a manuscript about a subset of research topics, team recommendation aims to recommend
                                    reviewers with top-k closest vectors to the vectors of the research.
                                  </li>
                                  <li><b> Palliative Care: </b>
                                    Another application of team recommendation is in healthcare, which assigns a team of caregivers to patients who
                                    seek help for their daily activities due to disease or disorders. The challenge lies in optimally assigning care
                                    providers in teams to address patients' needs while considering factors such as communication, distance, and contract costs.
