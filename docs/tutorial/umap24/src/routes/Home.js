          Collaborative team recommendation involves selecting users with
          certain skills to form a team who will, more likely than not,
          accomplish a complex task successfully. To automate the traditionally
          tedious and error-prone manual process of team formation, researchers
          from several scientific spheres have proposed methods to tackle the
          problem. In this tutorial, while providing a taxonomy of team
          recommendation works based on their algorithmic approaches to model
          skilled users in collaborative teams, we perform a comprehensive and
          hands-on study of the graph-based approaches that comprise the
          mainstream in this field, then cover the neural team recommenders as
          the cutting-edge class of approaches. Further, we provide unifying
          definitions, formulations, and evaluation schema. Last, we introduce
          details of training strategies, benchmarking datasets, and open-source
          tools, along with directions for future works.
