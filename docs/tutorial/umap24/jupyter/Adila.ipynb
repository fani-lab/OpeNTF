    "# What is `Adila`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Adila` is an extension of the `OpeNTF` framework, focusing on improving the fairness of neural team formation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, `Adila` attempts to mitigate popularity bias (and other forms of bias) through the application of greedy re-ranking algorithms when training neural team formation methods. The algorithms include:\n",
    "- [Score maximizing greedy mitigation algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500.3330691)\n",
    "- [Greedy conservative mitigation algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500.3330691)\n",
    "- [Relaxed variant of greedy conservative algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500.3330691)\n",
    "- [Probabilistic greedy re-ranking algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3132847.3132938)\n",

    "# Quickstart\n",
    "The following is a sample run of `Adila` using a toy dataset modelled about the DBLP dataset. The arguments it employed are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-fteamsvecs`: the sparse matrix representation of all teams in a pickle file.\n",
    "- `-fsplit`: the split.json file that indicates the index (rowid) of teams whose members are predicted in `--pred`.\n",
    "- `-fpred`: a file or folder that includes the prediction files of a neural team formation methods in the format of `torch.ndarray`.\n",
    "- `-np_ratio`: the desired nonpopular ratio among members of predicted teams after mitigation process by re-ranking algorithms.\n",
    "- `-reranker`: fairness-aware reranking algorithms.\n",
    "- `-output`: the path to the reranked predictions of members for teams, as well as, the teams' success and fairness evaluation before and after mitigation process."
